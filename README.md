# Rotten-Potatoes

Rotten Potatoes is a mockup parody of the movie review website rottentomatoes.com. Rather than displaying real movie reviews, Rotten Potatoes displays AI movie reviews generated by [GPT-2](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-2-1-5b-release/), a text generating tool.

I started this project to learn HTML and CSS. This is my first exposure to web development so the code is not pretty. I hope to improve through practice.

I was thinking that someday I could host this website and let real users rate and comment on the AI generated movies. The top movies of the day/month/year would have a spotlight on the front page. Moreover, real users would be able to add reactions such as "funny", "sounds real", and "would watch" and other users could use these tags to filter the movies.
